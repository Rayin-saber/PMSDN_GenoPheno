	abstract = {Background
22q13 deletion syndrome, also known as Phelan-{McDermid} syndrome, is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia, delayed or absent speech, and autistic features. {SHANK}3 has been identified as the critical gene in the neurological and behavioral aspects of this syndrome. The phenotype of {SHANK}3 deficiency has been described primarily from case studies, with limited evaluation of behavioral and cognitive deficits. The present study used a prospective design and inter-disciplinary clinical evaluations to assess patients with {SHANK}3 deficiency, with the goal of providing a comprehensive picture of the medical and behavioral profile of the syndrome.

Methods
A serially ascertained sample of patients with {SHANK}3 deficiency (n = 32) was evaluated by a team of child psychiatrists, neurologists, clinical geneticists, molecular geneticists and psychologists. Patients were evaluated for autism spectrum disorder using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-G.

Results
Thirty participants with 22q13.3 deletions ranging in size from 101 kb to 8.45 Mb and two participants with de novo {SHANK}3 mutations were included. The sample was characterized by high rates of autism spectrum disorder: 27 (84\%) met criteria for autism spectrum disorder and 24 (75\%) for autistic disorder. Most patients (77\%) exhibited severe to profound intellectual disability and only five (19\%) used some words spontaneously to communicate. Dysmorphic features, hypotonia, gait disturbance, recurring upper respiratory tract infections, gastroesophageal reflux and seizures were also common. Analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations indicated that larger deletions were associated with increased levels of dysmorphic features, medical comorbidities and social communication impairments related to autism. Analyses of individuals with small deletions or point mutations identified features related to {SHANK}3 haploinsufficiency, including {ASD}, seizures and abnormal {EEG}, hypotonia, sleep disturbances, abnormal brain {MRI}, gastroesophageal reflux, and certain dysmorphic features.

Conclusions
This study supports findings from previous research on the severity of intellectual, motor, and speech impairments seen in {SHANK}3 deficiency, and highlights the prominence of autism spectrum disorder in the syndrome. Limitations of existing evaluation tools are discussed, along with the need for natural history studies to inform clinical monitoring and treatment development in {SHANK}3 deficiency.},

	abstract = {The 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, also known as Phelan-{McDermid} syndrome, is a contiguous gene disorder resulting from deletion of the distal long arm of chromosome 22. In addition to normal growth and a constellation of minor dysmorphic features, this syndrome is characterized by neurological deficits which include global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual impairment, absent or severely delayed speech, and neonatal hypotonia. In addition, more than 50\% of patients show autism or autistic-like behavior, and therefore it can be classified as a syndromic form of autism spectrum disorders ({ASD}). The differential diagnosis includes Angelman syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and {FG} syndrome. Over 600 cases of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome have been documented. Most are terminal deletions of ∼100 kb to {\textgreater}9 Mb, resulting from simple deletions, ring chromosomes, and unbalanced translocations. Almost all of these deletions include the gene {SHANK}3 which encodes a scaffold protein in the postsynaptic densities of excitatory synapses, connecting membrane-bound receptors to the actin cytoskeleton. Two mouse knockout models and cell culture experiments show that {SHANK}3 is involved in the structure and function of synapses and support the hypothesis that the majority of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome neurological defects are due to haploinsufficiency of {SHANK}3, although other genes in the region may also play a role in the syndrome. The molecular connection to {ASD} suggests that potential future treatments may involve modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors.},

	abstract = {Phelan-{McDermid} syndrome (22q13.3 deletion syndrome) is characterized by neonatal hypotonia, global developmental delay, absent to severely delayed speech, and normal to accelerated growth. Most individuals have moderate to profound intellectual disability. Other features include large fleshy hands, dysplastic toenails, and decreased perspiration that results in a tendency to overheat. Behavior characteristics include mouthing or chewing non-food items, decreased perception of pain, and autistic-like affect., Clinical diagnostic criteria for Phelan-{McDermid} syndrome have not been established. Phelan-{McDermid} syndrome results from terminal or interstitial deletion of chromosome 22q13.3. On rare occasion an apparently balanced chromosome rearrangement or a mutation disrupts {SHANK}3. Prior to about 2006, deletion of 22q13.3 was commonly diagnosed by high resolution chromosome analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization ({FISH}); since 2006, chromosome microarray analysis ({CMA}), a more sensitive and accurate method for detecting this deletion, is preferred., Treatment of manifestations: Oral-motor therapy for chewing and swallowing problems; standard treatment of gastroesophageal reflux, seizures, recurrent ear infection and ophthalmic, cardiac, renal, respiratory, and immunologic issues; physical and occupational therapy and exercise to improve coordination and strength; augmented communication strategies; orthodontic therapy for malocclusion; medication for hyperactivity, anxiety, and self-stimulatory behavior. Surveillance: Baseline renal ultrasound examination for identification of presymptomatic kidney abnormalities; baseline brain imaging for the presence of arachnoid cysts with evaluation by a neurologist if behavior problems or regression of skills become evident; attention to symptoms of possible increased intracranial pressure; routine follow up of cardiac abnormalities; routine dental and eye examinations; monitoring for lymphedema which may appear in adolescence or adulthood. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Exposure to high temperatures and extended periods in the sun because of decreased perspiration., Phelan-{McDermid} syndrome results from a de novo or inherited chromosome abnormality, which can be determined by parental chromosome analysis. Prenatal testing for 22q13.3 deletion is possible for pregnancies at increased risk.},

	abstract = {{SHANK}3 is a synaptic scaffolding protein enriched in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses, and plays important roles in the formation, maturation, and maintenance of synapses. Haploinsufficiency of the {SHANK}3 gene causes a developmental disorder, 22q13.3 deletion syndrome (known as Phelan-{McDermid} syndrome), that is characterized by severe expressive language and speech delay, hypotonia, global developmental delay, and autistic behavior. Since several {SHANK}3 mutations have been identified in a particular phenotypic group in patients with autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}), the {SHANK}3 is strongly suspected of being involved in the pathogenesis and neuropathology of {ASD}. Five {CpG}-islands have been identified in the {SHANK}3 gene, and tissue-specific expression of {SHANK}3 is regulated by {DNA} methylation in an epigenetic manner. Cumulative evidence has shown that several {SHANK}3 variants are expressed in the developing rodent brain and that their expression is regulated by {DNA} methylation of intragenic promoters. We identified novel {SHANK}3 transcripts whose transcription started at the vicinity of the {CpG}-island 2 in the mouse brain. Shank3 mutant mice exhibit autistic-like behaviors, including impaired social interaction and repetitive behaviors. In this article we review recent findings in regard to higher brain functions of {SHANK}3, epigenetic regulation of {SHANK}3 expression, and {SHANK}3-related {ASD} that were obtained from genetic analyses in {ASD} patients, molecular biological studies using developing mouse brains, and studies of Shank3 mutant mice.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders ({ASDs}) include three main conditions: autistic disorder ({AD}), pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified ({PDD}-{NOS}), and Asperger syndrome. It has been shown that many genes associated with {ASDs} are involved in the neuroligin-neurexin interaction at the glutamate synapse: {NLGN}3, {NLGN}4, {NRXN}1, {CNTNAP}2, and {SHANK}3. We screened this last gene in two cohorts of {ASD} patients (133 patients from {US} and 88 from Italy). We found 5/221 (2.3\%) cases with pathogenic alterations: a 106 kb deletion encompassing the {SHANK}3 gene, two frameshift mutations leading to premature stop codons, a missense mutation (p.Pro141Ala), and a splicing mutation (c.1820-4 G{\textgreater}A). Additionally, in 17 patients (7.7\%) we detected a c.1304+48C{\textgreater}T transition affecting a methylated cytosine in a {CpG} island. This variant is reported as {SNP} rs76224556 and was found in both {US} and Italian controls, but it results significantly more frequent in our cases than in the control cohorts. The variant is also significantly more common among {PDD}-{NOS} cases than in {AD} cases. We also screened this gene in an independent replication cohort of 104 {US} patients with {ASDs}, in which we found a missense mutation (p.Ala1468Ser) in 1 patient (0.9\%), and in 8 patients (7.7\%) we detected the c.1304+48C{\textgreater}T transition. While {SHANK}3 variants are present in any {ASD} subtype, the {SNP} rs76224556 appears to be significantly associated with {PDD}-{NOS} cases. This represents the first evidence of a genotype-phenotype correlation in {ASDs} and highlights the importance of a detailed clinical-neuropsychiatric evaluation for the effective genetic screening of {ASD} patients.},

Recently, abnormality at the synapse is found to be important etiology of {ASD}. {SHANK}3 gene is suggested as a strong candidate gene for the pathogenesis of {ASD}, because it is essential for normally synaptic structure and function. We performed a case-control study to identify association between rs9616915 of the {SHANK}3 gene and {ASD} in a Chinese population. Genomic {DNA} was extracted from oral swabs samples of 212 patients and 636 controls and the {SNP} genotypes were determined by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymerase assay. Significant difference in genotype distribution of rs9616915 was observed between cases and controls by Pearson's χ(2) test (χ(2) = 6.92, P = 0.031). Genetic analysis of heterozygous model, dominant model and additive model showed an association of the C allele of the rs9616915 with {ASD} (e.g., additive model, {OR} 0.582, 95\% {CI} 0.359-0.942, P = 0.028).

Mutations in {SHANK} genes have been associated with autism spectrum disorders ({ASD}), but their prevalence and clinical relevance remain to be determined. Here, we performed a new screen and a meta-analysis of {SHANK} copy-number and coding-sequence variants in {ASD}. Copy-number variants were analyzed in 5,657 patients and 19,163 controls, coding-sequence variants were ascertained in 760 to 2,147 patients and 492 to 1,090 controls (depending on the gene), and, individuals carrying de novo or truncating {SHANK} mutations underwent an extensive clinical investigation. Copy-number variants and truncating mutations in {SHANK} genes were present in ∼1\% of patients with {ASD}: mutations in {SHANK}1 were rare (0.04\%) and present in males with normal {IQ} and autism; mutations in {SHANK}2 were present in 0.17\% of patients with {ASD} and mild intellectual disability; mutations in {SHANK}3 were present in 0.69\% of patients with {ASD} and up to 2.12\% of the cases with moderate to profound intellectual disability. In summary, mutations of the {SHANK} genes were detected in the whole spectrum of autism with a gradient of severity in cognitive impairment. Given the rare frequency of {SHANK}1 and {SHANK}2 deleterious mutations, the clinical relevance of these genes remains to be ascertained. In contrast, the frequency and the penetrance of {SHANK}3 mutations in individuals with {ASD} and intellectual disability-more than 1 in 50-warrant its consideration for mutation screening in clinical practice.},

Highlights of the past year include the release of a browser for the first new human genome reference assembly in 4 years in December 2013 ({GRCh}38, {UCSC} hg38), a watershed comparative genomics annotation (100-species multiple alignment and conservation) and a novel distribution mechanism for the browser ({GBiB}: Genome Browser in a Box). We created browsers for new species (Chinese hamster, elephant shark, minke whale), 'mined the web' for {DNA} sequences and expanded the browser display with stacked color graphs and region highlighting. As our user community increasingly adopts the {UCSC} track hub and assembly hub representations for sharing large-scale genomic annotation data sets and genome sequencing projects, our menu of public data hubs has tripled.},

Unlike most existing genome browsers, where the genome is rendered into images on the webserver and the role of the client is restricted to displaying those images, {JBrowse} distributes work between the server and client and therefore uses significantly less server overhead than previous genome browsers.

	abstract = {Genome browsers have gained importance as more genomes and related genomic information become available. However, the increase of information brought about by new generation sequencing technologies is, at the same time, causing a subtle but continuous decrease in the efficiency of conventional genome browsers. Here, we present Genome Maps, a genome browser that implements an innovative model of data transfer and management. The program uses highly efficient technologies from the new {HTML}5 standard, such as scalable vector graphics, that optimize workloads at both server and client sides and ensure future scalability. Thus, data management and representation are entirely carried out by the browser, without the need of any Java Applet, Flash or other plug-in technology installation. Relevant biological data on genes, transcripts, exons, regulatory features, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, karyotype and so forth, are imported from web services and are available as tracks. In addition, several {DAS} servers are already included in Genome Maps. As a novelty, this web-based genome browser allows the local upload of huge genomic data files (e.g. {VCF} or {BAM}) that can be dynamically visualized in real time at the client side, thus facilitating the management of medical data affected by privacy restrictions. Finally, Genome Maps can easily be integrated in any web application by including only a few lines of code. Genome Maps is an open source collaborative initiative available in the {GitHub} repository (https://github.com/compbio-bigdata-viz/genome-maps). Genome Maps is available at: http://www.genomemaps.org.},

	abstract = {Background The clinical features of Phelan–{McDermid} syndrome (also known as 22q13 deletion syndrome) are highly variable and include hypotonia, speech and other developmental delays, autistic traits and mildly dysmorphic features. Patient deletion sizes are also highly variable, prompting this genotype–phenotype association study.
Methods Terminal deletion breakpoints were identified for 71 individuals in a patient cohort using a custom-designed high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridisation platform with a resolution of 100 bp.
Results Patient deletion sizes were highly variable, ranging from 0.22 to 9.22 Mb, and no common breakpoint was observed. {SHANK}3, the major candidate gene for the neurologic features of the syndrome, was deleted in all cases. Sixteen features (neonatal hypotonia, neonatal hyporeflexia, neonatal feeding problems, speech/language delay, delayed age at crawling, delayed age at walking, severity of developmental delay, male genital anomalies, dysplastic toenails, large or fleshy hands, macrocephaly, tall stature, facial asymmetry, full brow, atypical reflexes and dolichocephaly) were found to be significantly associated with larger deletion sizes, suggesting the role of additional genes or regulatory regions proximal to {SHANK}3. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders ({ASDs}) were found to have smaller deletion sizes (median deletion size of 3.39 Mb) than those without {ASDs} (median deletion size 6.03 Mb, p=0.0144). This may reflect the difficulty in diagnosing {ASDs} in individuals with severe developmental delay.
Conclusions This genotype–phenotype analysis explains some of the phenotypic variability in the syndrome and identifies new genomic regions with a high likelihood for causing important developmental phenotypes such as speech delay.},

	abstract = {Phelan-{McDermid} syndrome, also known as the 22q13 deletion syndrome, is a chromosomal microdeletion syndrome characterized by neonatal hypotonia, normal growth, profound developmental delay, absent or delayed speech, and minor dysmorphic features. Almost all of the 22q13 deletions published so far have been described as terminal. It is believed that the {SHANK}3 gene is the major candidate gene for the neurologic features of the syndrome. Here we describe a patient with a 0.72-Mb interstitial 22q13.2 deletion, intellectual disability, autistic behavior, epilepsy, mild dysmorphic features, and no deletion in the {SHANK}3 gene. The patient also has urticarial rash and an elevated level of immunoglobulin E, the latter has previously been described only once in a patient with monosomy 22q13.2-qter and {SHANK}3 gene deletion. To our knowledge, this is one of the smallest interstitial deletion in this region which has been published up to now. Although the patient has the classic phenotype of the 22q13 terminal deletion syndrome, the etiology for the neurologic and immunological features must be due to genes located more proximal to {SHANK}3 and this is also supported by other previously published cases of interstitial 22q13.2 deletions. The deleted area in our patient is gene-rich (26 genes), containing several known genes with different functions. Two of them—{NFAM}1 and {TNFRSF}13C are involved in immune system functioning. We suggest the haploinsufficiency of these genes might be related to hyper {IgE} syndrome in our patient. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Mutations in more than 500 genes have been associated with intellectual disability ({ID}) and related disorders of cognitive function, such as autism and schizophrenia. Here we aimed to unravel the molecular epidemiology of non-specific {ID} in a genetic isolate using a combination of population and molecular genetic approaches. A large multigenerational pedigree was ascertained within a Dagestan Genetic Heritage research program in a genetic isolate of indigenous ethnics. Clinical characteristics of the affected members were based on combining diagnoses from regional psychiatric hospitals with our own clinical assessment, using a Russian translation of the structured psychiatric interviews, the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies and the Family Interview for Genetic Studies, based on {DSM}-{IV} criteria. Weber/{CHLC} 9.0 {STRs} set was used for multipoint parametric linkage analyses (Simwalk2.91). Next, we checked {CNVs} and {LOH} (based on Affymetrix {SNP} 5.0 data) in the linked with {ID} genomic regions with the aim to identify candidate genes associated with mutations in linked regions. The number of statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) suggestive linkage peaks with 1.3 {\textless} {LOD} {\textless} 3.0 we detected in a total of 10 genomic regions: 1q41, 2p25.3-p24.2, 3p13-p12.1, 4q13.3, 10p11, 11q23, 12q24.22-q24.31, 17q24.2-q25.1, 21q22.13 and 22q12.3-q13.1. Three significant linkage signals with {LOD} {\textgreater}3 were obtained at 2p25.3-p24.2 under the dominant model, with a peak at 21 {cM} flanked by loci D2S2976 and D2S2952; at 12q24.22-q24.31 under the recessive model, with a peak at −120 {cM} flanked by marker D12S2070 and D12S395 and at 22q12.3 under the dominant model, with a peak at 32 {cM} flanked by marker D22S683 and D22S445. After a set of genes had been designated as possible candidates in these specific chromosomal regions,we conducted an exploratory search for {LOH} and {CNV} based on microarray data to detect structural genomic variants within five {ID}-linked regions with {LOD} scores between 2.0 and 3.9. In these selected regions we obtained 173 {ROH} segments and 98 {CN} segments. Further analysis of region 2p25.3-p24.2 revealed deletions within genes encoding {MYTL}, {SNTG}2 and {TPO} among five of 21 affected cases at 2p25.3-p24.2. In the {ID}-linked region at 12q24.22-12q24.31 19 out of 21 {ID} cases carried segmental {CNV} and 20 of 21 them displayed {ROH} segments with mean size lengths for {ID} cases 2512 kb (500–6,472 kb) and for healthy control 682 kb (531–986 kb), including the genes {MED}13L, {HRK}, {FBXW}8, {TESC}, {CDK}2AP1 and {SBNO}1. Seven of 21 affected pedigree members displayed segmental deletions at 22q12.3 that includes the gene {LARGE}. Eight affected pedigree members carried {ROH} segments and 6 {CN} segments at 10p11.23-p11.21 containing the genes {ZEB}1, c10orf68 and {EPC}1. Our linkage and structural genomic variation analyses in a remote highland genetic isolate with aggregation of {ID} demonstrated that even highly isolated single kindred {ID} has oligo/polygenic pathogenesis. The results obtained implicate 10 genomic regions linked with {ID} that contain some of previously reported candidate genes, including {HRK}, {FBXW}8, {TESC}, {CDK}2AP1 and {SBNO}1 at 12q24 that were shown in recent studies as associated with brain measures derived from {MRI} scans.},

We report two children with interstitial deletions of 22q13 and two copies of {SHANK}3, but clinical features similar to the terminal 22q13 deletion syndrome, including mental retardation and severe speech delay. Both these interstitial deletions are completely contained within the largest terminal deletion, but do not overlap with the nine smallest terminal deletions. These interstitial deletions indicate that haploinsufficiency for 22q13 genes other than {SHANK}3 can have major effects on cognitive and language development. However, the relatively mild speech problems and normal cognitive abilities of a parent who transmitted her identical interstitial deletion to her more severely affected son suggests that the phenotype associated with this region may be more variable than terminal deletions and therefore contribute to the relative lack of correlation between clinical severity and size of terminal deletions. The phenotypic similarity between the interstitial deletions and non-overlapping small terminal 22q13 deletions emphasizes the general nonspecificity of the clinical picture of the 22q13 deletion syndrome and the importance of molecular analysis for diagnosis.},

Experimental disruption of the {IB}2 gene in mice reduces {AMPA} and enhances {NMDA} receptor-mediated glutamatergic transmission in cerebellum, changes the morphology of Purkinje cell dendritic arbors, and induces motor and cognitive deficits suggesting an autism phenotype. These findings support a role for human {IB}2 mutation as a contributing genetic factor in Chr22qter-associated cognitive disorders.},

	abstract = {{SHANK}3 is a protein in the core of the postsynaptic density ({PSD}) and has a critical role in recruiting many key functional elements to the {PSD} and to the synapse, including components of α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid ({AMPA}), metabotropic glutamate ({mGlu}) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid ({NMDA}) glutamate receptors, as well as cytoskeletal elements. Loss of a functional copy of the {SHANK}3 gene leads to the neurobehavioral manifestations of 22q13 deletion syndrome and/or to autism spectrum disorders. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of haploinsufficiency of full-length Shank3 in mice, focusing on synaptic development, transmission and plasticity, as well as on social behaviors, as a model for understanding {SHANK}3 haploinsufficiency in humans.

	abstract = {The {UCSC} Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu) is a graphical viewer for genomic data now in its 13th year. Since the early days of the Human Genome Project, it has presented an integrated view of genomic data of many kinds. Now home to assemblies for 58 organisms, the Browser presents visualization of annotations mapped to genomic coordinates. The ability to juxtapose annotations of many types facilitates inquiry-driven data mining. Gene predictions, {mRNA} alignments, epigenomic data from the {ENCODE} project, conservation scores from vertebrate whole-genome alignments and variation data may be viewed at any scale from a single base to an entire chromosome. The Browser also includes many other widely used tools, including {BLAT}, which is useful for alignments from high-throughput sequencing experiments. Private data uploaded as Custom Tracks and Data Hubs in many formats may be displayed alongside the rich compendium of precomputed data in the {UCSC} database. The Table Browser is a full-featured graphical interface, which allows querying, filtering and intersection of data tables. The Saved Session feature allows users to store and share customized views, enhancing the utility of the system for organizing multiple trains of thought. Binary Alignment/Map ({BAM}), Variant Call Format and the Personal Genome Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ({SNPs}) data formats are useful for visualizing a large sequencing experiment (whole-genome or whole-exome), where the differences between the data set and the reference assembly may be displayed graphically. Support for high-throughput sequencing extends to compact, indexed data formats, such as {BAM}, {bigBed} and {bigWig}, allowing rapid visualization of large datasets from {RNA}-seq and {ChIP}-seq experiments via local hosting.},

The deletion occurs with equal frequency in males and females and has been reported in mosaic and non-mosaic forms. Due to lack of clinical recognition and often insufficient laboratory testing, the syndrome is under-diagnosed and its true incidence remains unknown. Common physical traits include long eye lashes, large or unusual ears, relatively large hands, dysplastic toenails, full brow, dolicocephaly, full cheeks, bulbous nose, and pointed chin. Behavior is autistic-like with decreased perception of pain and habitual chewing or mouthing. The loss of 22q13.3 can result from simple deletion, translocation, ring chromosome formation and less common structural changes affecting the long arm of chromosome 22, specifically the region containing the {SHANK}3 gene. The diagnosis of deletion 22q13 syndrome should be considered in all cases of hypotonia of unknown etiology and in individuals with absent speech. Although the deletion can sometimes be detected by high resolution chromosome analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization ({FISH}) or array comparative genomic hybridization ({CGH}) is recommended for confirmation. Differential diagnosis includes syndromes associated with hypotonia, developmental delay, speech delay and/or autistic-like affect (Prader-Willi, Angelman, Williams, Smith-Magenis, Fragile X, Sotos, {FG}, trichorhinophalangeal and velocardiofacial syndromes, autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy). Genetic counseling is recommended and parental laboratory studies should be considered to identify cryptic rearrangements and detect parental mosaicism. Prenatal diagnosis should be offered for future pregnancies in those families with inherited rearrangements. Individuals with deletion 22q13 should have routine examinations by the primary care physician as well as genetic evaluations with referral to specialists if neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, or other systemic problems are suspected. Affected individuals benefit from early intervention programs, intense occupational and communication therapies, adaptive exercise and sport programs, and other therapies to strengthen their muscles and increase their communication skills. No apparent life-threatening organic abnormalities accompany the diagnosis of deletion 22q13.

Although the overall prevalence of {PMS} is unknown, there have been at least 1200 cases reported worldwide, according to the Phelan–{McDermid} Syndrome Foundation. {PMS} is now considered to be a relatively common cause of {ASD} and intellectual disability, accounting for between 0.5 \% and 2.0 \% of cases. The cause of {PMS} has been isolated to loss of function of one copy of {SHANK}3, which codes for a master scaffolding protein found in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. Reduced expression of {SH}3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 ({SHANK}3) leads to reduced numbers of dendrites, and impaired synaptic transmission and plasticity. Recent mouse and human neuronal models of {PMS} have led to important opportunities to develop novel therapeutics, and at least 2 clinical trials are underway, one in the {USA}, and one in the Netherlands. The {SHANK}3 pathway may also be relevant to other forms of {ASD}, and many of the single-gene causes of {ASD} identified to date appear to converge on several common molecular pathways that underlie synaptic neurotransmission. As a result, treatments developed for {PMS} may also affect other forms of {ASD}.},

Considering different age groups, in older patients, behavioral problems tended to subside, developmental abilities improved, and some features such as large or fleshy hands, full or puffy eyelids, hypotonia, lax ligaments, and hyperextensible joints were less frequent. However, the proportion reporting an autism spectrum disorder, seizures, and cellulitis, or presenting with lymphedema or abnormal reflexes increased with age. Some neurologic and dysmorphic features such as speech and developmental delay and macrocephaly correlated with deletion size. Deletion sizes in more recently diagnosed patients tend to be smaller than those diagnosed a decade earlier. Seventy-three percent of de novo deletions were of paternal origin. Seizures were reported three times more often among patients with a de novo deletion of the maternal rather than paternal chromosome 22. This analysis improves the understanding of the clinical presentation and natural history of {PMS} and can serve as a reference for the prevalence of clinical features in the syndrome.},

	abstract = {Phelan–{McDermid} syndrome is a developmental disability syndrome with varying deletions of 22q13 and varying clinical severity. We tested the hypothesis that, in addition to loss of the telomeric gene {SHANK}3, specific genomic regions within 22q13 are associated with important clinical features.
We used a customized oligo array comparative genomic hybridization of 22q12.3-terminus to obtain deletion breakpoints in a cohort of 70 patients with terminal 22q13 deletions. We used association and receiver operating characteristic statistical methods in a novel manner and also incorporated protein interaction networks to identify 22q13 genomic locations and genes associated with clinical features.
Specific genomic regions and candidate genes within 22q13.2q13.32 were associated with severity of speech/language delay, neonatal hypotonia, delayed age at walking, hair-pulling behaviors, male genital anomalies, dysplastic toenails, large/fleshy hands, macrocephaly, short and tall stature, facial asymmetry, and atypical reflexes. We also found regions suggestive of a negative association with autism spectrum disorders.
This work advances the field of research beyond the observation of a correlation between deletion size and phenotype and identifies candidate 22q13 loci, and in some cases specific genes, associated with singular clinical features observed in Phelan–{McDermid} syndrome. Our statistical approach may be useful in genotype–phenotype analyses for other microdeletion or microduplication syndromes.

	abstract = {The association of copy number variation ({CNV}) with schizophrenia has been reported with evidence of increased frequency of both rare and large {CNVs}. Yet, little is known about the impact of {CNVs} in brain structure. In this pilot study, we explored collective effects of all {CNVs} in each cytogenetic band on the risk of schizophrenia and gray matter variation measured in structural magnetic resonance imaging. With 324 participants’ {CNV} profiles (151 schizophrenia patients and 173 healthy controls), we first extracted specific {CNV} features that differ between patients and controls using a two sample t-test, and then tested their associations with gray matter concentration using a linear regression model in a subset of 301 participants. Our data first provided evidence of population structure in {CNV} features where elevated rare {CNV} burden in schizophrenia patients was confounded by the levels associated with African American subjects. We considered this ethnic group difference in the following cytoband analyses. Deletions in one cytoband 22q13.31 were observed significantly (p{\textless}0.05) more in patients than controls from all samples after controlling ethnicity, and the deletion load was also significantly (p = 1.44×10−4) associated with reduced gray matter concentration of a brain network mainly comprised of the cingulate gyrus and insula. Since 80\% deletion carriers were patients, patients with deletions also showed reduced gray matter concentration compared with patients without deletions (p = 3.36×10−4). Our findings indicate that regional {CNVs} at 22q13.31, no matter the size, may influence the risk of schizophrenia with a remarkably increased mutation rate and with reduced gray matter concentration in the peri-limbic cortex. This proof-of-concept study suggests that the {CNVs} occurring at some ‘hotspots’ may in fact cause biological downstream effects and larger studies are important for confirming our initial results.},

Two patients with hemizygous chromosome 22q13.3 telomeric deletion were referred to us when brain-imaging studies revealed cerebellar vermis hypoplasia ({CBVH}). To determine whether developmental abnormalities of the cerebellum are a consistent feature of the 22q13.3 deletion syndrome, we examined brain-imaging studies for 10 unrelated subjects with 22q13 terminal deletion. In seven cases where the availability of {DNA} and array technology allowed, we mapped deletion boundaries using comparative intensity analysis with single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) microarrays. Approximate deletion boundaries for three additional cases were derived from clinical or published molecular data. We also examined brain-imaging studies for a patient with an intragenic {SHANK}3 mutation. We report the first brain-imaging data showing that some patients with 22q13 deletions have severe posterior {CBVH}, and one individual with a {SHANK}3 mutation has a normal cerebellum. This genotype–phenotype study suggests that the 22q13 deletion phenotype includes abnormal posterior fossa structures that are unlikely to be attributed to {SHANK}3 disruption. Other genes in the region, including {PLXNB}2 and {MAPK}8IP2, display brain expression patterns and mouse mutant phenotypes critical for proper cerebellar development.

Although the frequency of 22q13 deletions in {ID} is unclear, it is believed to be largely underestimated. To address this issue, we used Affymetrix Human {SNP} 6.0 array to detect the 22q13 deletions in 234 Chinese unexplained {ID} patients and 103 controls. After the Quality Control ({QC}) test of raw data, 22q13 deletions were found in four out of 230 cases (1.7\%), while absent in parents of the cases and 101 controls. A review of genome-wide microarray studies in {ID} was performed and the frequency of 22q13 deletions from the literatures was 0.24\%, much lower than our report. The overlapping region shared by all 4 cases encompasses the gene {SHANK}3. A heterozygous de novo nonsense mutation Y1015X of {SHANK}3 was identified in one {ID} patient. Cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic mice and were transfected with a control plasmid, shank3 wild-type ({WT}) or mutant plasmids. Overexpression of the Y1015 mutant in neurons significantly affected neurite outgrowth compared with shank3 {WT}. These findings suggest that 22q13 deletions may be a more frequent cause for Chinese {ID} patients than previously thought, and the {SHANK}3 gene is involved in the neurite development.},

{RESULTS}: Similar to other terminal deletion syndromes, there was an overabundance of paternal deletions. The deletions vary widely in size, from 130 kb to over 9 Mb; however all 45 cases that could be specifically tested for the terminal region at the site of {SHANK}3 were deleted for this gene. The molecular structure of {SHANK}3 was further characterised. Comparison of clinical features to deletion size showed few correlations. Some measures of developmental assessment did correlate to deletion size; however, all patients showed some degree of mental retardation and severe delay or absence of expressive speech, regardless of deletion size.
{CONCLUSION}: Our analysis therefore supports haploinsufficiency of the gene {SHANK}3, which codes for a structural protein of the postsynaptic density, as a major causative factor in the neurological symptoms of 22q13 deletion syndrome.},

The patient's karyotype showed a de novo balanced translocation between chromosomes 12 and 22, with the breakpoint in the 22q13.3 critical region of the 22q distal deletion syndrome [46, {XY}, t(12;22)(q24.1;q13.3)]. {FISH} investigations revealed that the translocation was reciprocal, with the chromosome 22 breakpoint within the 22q subtelomeric cosmid 106G1220 and the chromosome 12q breakpoint near {STS} D12S317. Using Southern blot analysis and inverse {PCR}, we located the chromosome 12 breakpoint in an intron of the {FLJ}10659 gene and located the chromosome 22 breakpoint within exon 21 of the human homologue of the {ProSAP}2 gene. Short homologous sequences (5-bp, {CTG}[C/A]C) were found at the breakpoint on both derivative chromosomes. The translocation does not lead to the loss of any portion of {DNA}. Northern blot analysis of human tissues, using the rat {ProSAP}2 {cDNA}, showed that full-length transcripts were found only in the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum. The {FLJ}10659 gene is expressed in various tissues and does not show tissue-specific isoforms. The finding that {ProSAP}2 is included in the critical region of the 22q deletion syndrome and that our proband displays all signs and symptoms of the syndrome suggests that {ProSAP}2 haploinsufficiency is the cause of the 22q13.3 deletion syndrome. {ProSAP}2 is a good candidate for this syndrome, because it is preferentially expressed in the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum and encodes a scaffold protein involved in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses.},

	abstract = {Background
The 22q13.3 deletion syndrome (or Phelan-{McDermid} syndrome, {MIM} 606232) is characterized by developmental delay, absent or severely delayed speech, neonatal hypotonia, autistic behavior, normal to accelerated growth, and minor dysmorphic facial features. Among the three genes in the minimal critical region (from the centromere to the telomere: {SHANK}3, {ACR} and {RABL}2B), the defect in the {SHANK}3 gene is considered to be the cause of the neurobehavioral symptoms.
Objective
We describe the molecular characterization of a de novo interstitial del(22)(q13.3q13.3) disrupting the {SHANK}3 gene in a child with a phenotype compatible with the 22q13.3 deletion syndrome.
Methods
Clinical work-up included clinical histories, physical, neurological, and ophthalmological examinations, and imaging of the brain. Commercially available {MLPA} for subtelomeric analysis, {FISH} specific probes and quantitative real-time {PCR} were used to characterize the rearrangement.
Results
Subtelomere analysis by {MLPA} showed a discrepancy between P036B and P070 kits ({MCR} Holland®): the P070 {MLPA} 22q probe (targeting the {ARSA} gene) showed a deletion but the P036B one (targeting the {RABL}2B gene) showed a normal result. {FISH} analysis using {LSI} {TUPLE}1/{LSI} {ARSA} (Vysis®) probes confirmed deletion of {ARSA}, whereas {FISH} with N25/N85A3 (Cytocell®) probes, targeting the {SHANK}3 locus was normal. Supplemented {FISH} analysis using {BAC} clones allowed us to specify the centromeric breakpoint region of the interstitial deletion between clones {RP}11-354I12 and {RP}11-232E17, at less than 2 Mb from the telomere. Quantitative real-time {PCR} of exon 5, 22 and 24 and intron 9 of {SHANK}3 showed that the telomeric breakpoint occurred between intron 9 and exon 22.
Conclusions
These data highlight the difficulty of performing an appropriate test aimed at looking for cryptic 22q13.3 deletion. Furthermore, the molecular characterization of this interstitial 22q13.3 deletion contributes to the clinical and genetic delineation of the 22q13.3 deletion syndrome.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the {FWER} when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the {FWER} is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Moreover, this probability of a correct ranking is the same quantity that is estimated by the already well-studied nonparametric Wilcoxon statistic. These two relationships are exploited to (a) provide rapid closed-form expressions for the approximate magnitude of the sampling variability, i.e., standard error that one uses to accompany the area under a smoothed {ROC} curve, (b) guide in determining the size of the sample required to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate of this area, and (c) determine how large sample sizes should be to ensure that one can statistically detect differences in the accuracy of diagnostic techniques.},

The dependence of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity on the selected cut-off value must be considered for a full test evaluation and for test comparison. All possible combinations of sensitivity and specificity that can be achieved by changing the test's cut-off value can be summarised using a single parameter; the area under the {ROC} curve. The {ROC} technique can also be used to optimise cut-off values with regard to a given prevalence in the target population and cost ratio of false-positive and false-negative results. However, plots of optimisation parameters against the selected cut-off value provide a more-direct method for cut-off selection. Candidates for such optimisation parameters are linear combinations of sensitivity and specificity (with weights selected to reflect the decision-making situation), odds ratio, chance-corrected measures of association (e. g. kappa) and likelihood ratios. We discuss some recent developments in {ROC} analysis, including meta-analysis of diagnostic tests, correlated {ROC} curves (paired-sample design) and chance- and prevalence-corrected {ROC} curves.},

	abstract = {{GeneCards} (www.genecards.org) is a comprehensive, authoritative compendium of annotative information about human genes, widely used for nearly 15 years. Its gene-centric content is automatically mined and integrated from over 80 digital sources, resulting in a web-based deep-linked card for each of {\textgreater}73,000 human gene entries, encompassing the following categories: protein coding, pseudogene, {RNA} gene, genetic locus, cluster and uncategorized. We now introduce {GeneCards} Version 3, featuring a speedy and sophisticated search engine and a revamped, technologically enabling infrastructure, catering to the expanding needs of biomedical researchers. A key focus is on gene-set analyses, which leverage {GeneCards}' unique wealth of combinatorial annotations. These include the {GeneALaCart} batch query facility, which tabulates user-selected annotations for multiple genes and {GeneDecks}, which identifies similar genes with shared annotations, and finds set-shared annotations by descriptor enrichment analysis. Such set-centric features address a host of applications, including microarray data analysis, cross-database annotation mapping and gene-disorder associations for drug targeting.

	abstract = {Phelan-{McDermid} syndrome ({PMDS}) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by global developmental delay, severely impaired speech, intellectual disability, and an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders ({ASDs}). {PMDS} is caused by heterozygous deletions of chromosome 22q13.3. Among the genes in the deleted region is {SHANK}3, which encodes a protein in the postsynaptic density ({PSD}). Rare mutations in {SHANK}3 have been associated with idiopathic {ASDs}, non-syndromic intellectual disability, and schizophrenia. Although {SHANK}3 is considered to be the most likely candidate gene for the neurological abnormalities in {PMDS} patients, the cellular and molecular phenotypes associated with this syndrome in human neurons are unknown. We generated induced pluripotent stem ({iPS}) cells from individuals with {PMDS} and autism and used them to produce functional neurons. We show that {PMDS} neurons have reduced {SHANK}3 expression and major defects in excitatory, but not inhibitory, synaptic transmission. Excitatory synaptic transmission in {PMDS} neurons can be corrected by restoring {SHANK}3 expression or by treating neurons with insulin-like growth factor 1 ({IGF}1). {IGF}1 treatment promotes formation of mature excitatory synapses that lack {SHANK}3 but contain {PSD}95 and N-methyl-D-aspartate ({NMDA}) receptors with fast deactivation kinetics. Our findings provide direct evidence for a disruption in the ratio of cellular excitation and inhibition in {PMDS} neurons, and point to a molecular pathway that can be recruited to restore it.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) is now understood to have multiple genetic risk genes and one example is {SHANK}3. {SHANK}3 deletions and mutations disrupt synaptic function and result in Phelan-{McDermid} syndrome ({PMS}), which causes a monogenic form of {ASD} with a frequency of at least 0.5\% of {ASD} cases. Recent evidence from preclinical studies with mouse and human neuronal models of {SHANK}3 deficiency suggest that insulin-like growth factor-1 ({IGF}-1) can reverse synaptic plasticity and motor learning deficits. The objective of this study was to pilot {IGF}-1 treatment in children with {PMS} to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy for core deficits of {ASD}, including social impairment and restricted and repetitive behaviors.
{METHODS}: Nine children with {PMS} aged 5 to 15 were enrolled in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design study, with 3 months of treatment with {IGF}-1 and 3 months of placebo in random order, separated by a 4-week wash-out period.
{RESULTS}: Compared to the placebo phase, the {IGF}-1 phase was associated with significant improvement in both social impairment and restrictive behaviors, as measured by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the Repetitive Behavior Scale, respectively. {IGF}-1 was found to be well tolerated and there were no serious adverse events in any participants.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This study establishes the feasibility of {IGF}-1 treatment in {PMS} and contributes pilot data from the first controlled treatment trial in the syndrome. Results also provide proof of concept to advance knowledge about developing targeted treatments for additional causes of {ASD} associated with impaired synaptic development and function.},

The final axis (7) platform support listed the availability of documentation and installation procedures. A large heterogeneity was observed in regard to the capability to manage phenotype information in addition to omics data, their security and interoperability features. The analytical and visualization features strongly depend on the considered platform. Similarly, the availability of the systems is variable. This review aims at providing the reader with the background to choose the platform best suited to their needs.

We performed an extensive association study for primary {VUR} using a two-stage, case-control design, investigating 44 candidate genes in the ureteric budding pathway in 409 Dutch {VUR} patients. The 44 genes were selected from the literature and a set of 567 single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) capturing their genetic variation was genotyped in 207 cases and 554 controls. The 14 {SNPs} with p{\textless}0.005 were included in a follow-up study in 202 cases and 892 controls. Of the total cohort, {\textasciitilde}50\% showed a clear-cut primary {VUR} phenotype and {\textasciitilde}25\% had both a duplex collecting system and {VUR}. We also looked for association in these two extreme phenotype groups. None of the {SNPs} reached a significant p-value.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Renal hypodysplasia, characterized by a decrease in nephron number, small overall kidney size, and maldeveloped renal tissue, is a leading cause of chronic renal failure in young children. Familial clustering and renal hypodysplasia phenotypes observed in transgenic animal models suggest a genetic contribution. Uroplakin {IIIa} (encoded by {UPIIIA}) is an integral membrane protein present in urothelial plaques, and the murine {UPIIIa} knockout is associated with urothelial anomalies and vesicoureteral reflux. De novo {UPIIIA} mutations recently were identified in 4 of 17 patients with severe bilateral renal adysplasia.
{METHODS}: To evaluate the overall role of {UPIIIA} in human renal hypodysplasia pathogenesis, we performed {UPIIIA} mutation analysis in a cohort of 170 pediatric patients affected by severe unilateral or bilateral renal hypodysplasia. Eighty-one patients were affected by bilateral nonobstructive renal hypodysplasia; of these, 61 were without vesicoureteral reflux. Eighty-four patients presented with unilateral nonobstructive renal hypodysplasia, including 24 patients with unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidneys. Family history was positive in 11\%.
{RESULTS}: Mutation analysis showed 2 heterozygous mutations not observed in 200 race-matched control chromosomes. In only 1 family was distribution of the {UPIIIA} mutation consistent with a disease-causing effect. This de novo missense mutation (Gly202Asp) was identified in a patient with unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidneys. The second (intronically located) mutation appeared unlikely to be disease causing because it did not segregate with an obvious disease phenotype in the affected family.
{CONCLUSION}: Our results indicate that de novo mutations in {UPIIIA} can be involved in defective early kidney development, but probably constitute only a rare cause of human renal hypodysplasia in a minor subset of individuals.},

We propose a novel method to scan phenomic data for genetic associations using International Classification of Disease ({ICD}9) billing codes, which are available in most {EMR} systems. We have developed a code translation table to automatically define 776 different disease populations and their controls using prevalent {ICD}9 codes derived from {EMR} data. As a proof of concept of this algorithm, we genotyped the first 6005 European-Americans accrued into {BioVU}, Vanderbilt's {DNA} biobank, at five single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) with previously reported disease associations: atrial fibrillation, Crohn's disease, carotid artery stenosis, coronary artery disease, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. The {PheWAS} software generated cases and control populations across all {ICD}9 code groups for each of these five {SNPs}, and disease-{SNP} associations were analyzed. The primary outcome of this study was replication of seven previously known {SNP}-disease associations for these {SNPs}.
{RESULTS}: Four of seven known {SNP}-disease associations using the {PheWAS} algorithm were replicated with P-values between 2.8 x 10(-6) and 0.011. The {PheWAS} algorithm also identified 19 previously unknown statistical associations between these {SNPs} and diseases at P {\textless} 0.01. This study indicates that {PheWAS} analysis is a feasible method to investigate {SNP}-disease associations. Further evaluation is needed to determine the validity of these associations and the appropriate statistical thresholds for clinical significance.

	abstract = {Because autism spectrum disorders are neurodevelopmental disorders and patients typically display symptoms before the age of three, one of the key questions in autism research is whether the pathology is reversible in adults. Here we investigate the developmental requirement of Shank3 in mice, a prominent monogenic autism gene that is estimated to contribute to approximately 1\% of all autism spectrum disorder cases. {SHANK}3 is a postsynaptic scaffold protein that regulates synaptic development, function and plasticity by orchestrating the assembly of postsynaptic density macromolecular signalling complex. Disruptions of the Shank3 gene in mouse models have resulted in synaptic defects and autistic-like behaviours including anxiety, social interaction deficits, and repetitive behaviour. We generated a novel Shank3 conditional knock-in mouse model, and show that re-expression of the Shank3 gene in adult mice led to improvements in synaptic protein composition, spine density and neural function in the striatum. We also provide behavioural evidence that certain behavioural abnormalities including social interaction deficit and repetitive grooming behaviour could be rescued, while anxiety and motor coordination deficit could not be recovered in adulthood. Together, these results reveal the profound effect of post-developmental activation of Shank3 expression on neural function, and demonstrate a certain degree of continued plasticity in the adult diseased brain.},

	volume = {151},

	abstract = {Urothelium synthesizes a group of integral membrane proteins called uroplakins, which form two-dimensional crystals (urothelial plaques) covering {\textgreater}90\% of the apical urothelial surface. We show that the ablation of the mouse uroplakin {III} ({UPIII}) gene leads to overexpression, defective glycosylation, and abnormal targeting of uroplakin Ib, the presumed partner of {UPIII}. The {UPIII}-depleted urothelium features small plaques, becomes leaky, and has enlarged ureteral orifices resulting in the back flow of urine, hydronephrosis, and altered renal function indicators. Thus, {UPIII} is an integral subunit of the urothelial plaque and contributes to the permeability barrier function of the urothelium, and {UPIII} deficiency can lead to global anomalies in the urinary tract. The ablation of a single urothelial-specific gene can therefore cause primary vesicoureteral reflux ({VUR}), a hereditary disease affecting approximately 1\% of pregnancies and representing a leading cause of renal failure in infants. The fact that {VUR} caused by {UPIII} deletion seems distinct from that caused by the deletion of angiotensin receptor {II} gene suggests the existence of {VUR} subtypes. Mutations in multiple gene, including some that are urothelial specific, may therefore cause different subtypes of primary reflux. Studies of {VUR} in animal models caused by well-defined genetic defects should lead to improved molecular classification, prenatal diagnosis, and therapy of this important hereditary problem.},

 title = {The therapeutic potential of insulin-like growth factor-1 in central nervous
      system disorders.},
 abstract = {Central nervous system (CNS) development is a finely tuned process that relies on
      multiple factors and intricate pathways to ensure proper neuronal
      differentiation, maturation, and connectivity. Disruption of this process can
      cause significant impairments in CNS functioning and lead to debilitating
      disorders that impact motor and language skills, behavior, and cognitive
      functioning. Recent studies focused on understanding the underlying cellular
      mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders have identified a crucial role for
      insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in normal CNS development. Work in model
      systems has demonstrated rescue of pathophysiological and behavioral
      abnormalities when IGF-1 is administered, and several clinical studies have shown
      promise of efficacy in disorders of the CNS, including autism spectrum disorder
      (ASD). In this review, we explore the molecular pathways and downstream effects
      of IGF-1 and summarize the results of completed and ongoing pre-clinical and
      clinical trials using IGF-1 as a pharmacologic intervention in various CNS
      disorders. This aim of this review is to provide evidence for the potential of
      IGF-1 as a treatment for neurodevelopmental disorders and ASD.},

 title = {A Brazilian cohort of individuals with Phelan-McDermid syndrome:
      genotype-phenotype correlation and identification of an atypical case.},
 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) is a rare genetic disorder
      characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disability (ID), autism
      spectrum disorder (ASD), and mild dysmorphisms associated with several
      comorbidities caused by SHANK3 loss-of-function mutations. Although SHANK3
      haploinsufficiency has been associated with the major neurological symptoms of
      PMS, it cannot explain the clinical variability seen among individuals. Our goals
      were to characterize a Brazilian cohort of PMS individuals, explore the
      genotype-phenotype correlation underlying this syndrome, and describe an atypical
      individual with mild phenotype. METHODOLOGY: A total of 34 PMS individuals were
      clinically and genetically evaluated. Data were obtained by a questionnaire
      answered by parents, and dysmorphic features were assessed via photographic
      evaluation. We analyzed 22q13.3 deletions and other potentially pathogenic copy
      number variants (CNVs) and also performed genotype-phenotype correlation analysis
      to determine whether comorbidities, speech status, and ASD correlate to deletion
      size. Finally, a Brazilian cohort of 829 ASD individuals and another independent
      cohort of 2297 ID individuals was used to determine the frequency of PMS in these
      disorders. RESULTS: Our data showed that 21% (6/29) of the PMS individuals
      presented an additional rare CNV, which may contribute to clinical variability in
      PMS. Increased pain tolerance (80%), hypotonia (85%), and sparse eyebrows (80%)
      were prominent clinical features. An atypical case diagnosed with PMS at 18 years
      old and IQ within the normal range is here described. Among Brazilian ASD or ID
      individuals referred to CNV analyses, the frequency of 22q13.3 deletion was 0.6%
      (5/829) and 0.61% (15/2297), respectively. Finally, renal abnormalities,
      lymphedema, and language impairment were found to be positively associated with
      deletion sizes, and the minimum deletion to cause these abnormalities is here
      suggested. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first work describing a cohort of Brazilian
      individuals with PMS. Our results confirm the impact of 22q13 deletions on ASD
      and several comorbidities, such as hypotonia. The estimation of a minimal
      deletion size for developing lymphedema and renal problem can assist prediction
      of prognosis in PMS individuals, particularly those diagnosed in early infancy.
      We also identified one atypical individual carrying SHANK3 deletion, suggesting
      that resilience to such mutations occurs. This case expands the clinical spectrum
      of variability in PMS and opens perspectives to identify protective mechanisms
      that can minimize the severity of this condition.},

 title = {Autism-associated SHANK3 haploinsufficiency causes Ih channelopathy in human
      neurons.},
 abstract = {Heterozygous SHANK3 mutations are associated with idiopathic autism and
      Phelan-McDermid syndrome. SHANK3 is a ubiquitously expressed scaffolding protein
      that is enriched in postsynaptic excitatory synapses. Here, we used engineered
      conditional mutations in human neurons and found that heterozygous and homozygous
      SHANK3 mutations severely and specifically impaired hyperpolarization-activated
      cation (Ih) channels. SHANK3 mutations caused alterations in neuronal morphology
      and synaptic connectivity; chronic pharmacological blockage of Ih channels
      reproduced these phenotypes, suggesting that they may be secondary to Ih-channel
      impairment. Moreover, mouse Shank3-deficient neurons also exhibited severe
      decreases in Ih currents. SHANK3 protein interacted with
      hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel proteins (HCN
      proteins) that form Ih channels, indicating that SHANK3 functions to organize HCN
      channels. Our data suggest that SHANK3 mutations predispose to autism, at least
      partially, by inducing an Ih channelopathy that may be amenable to
      pharmacological intervention.},
